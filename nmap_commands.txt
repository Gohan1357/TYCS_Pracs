nmap -sn <target> 
	- Perform a ping scan to discover live hosts on the network.

nmap -sT <target> 
	- Perform a TCP connect scan, which establishes a full TCP connection to each port to determine its state.

nmap -sS <target> 
	- Perform a SYN scan, also known as stealth scan, by sending SYN packets to each port and analyzing responses to determine open ports.

nmap -sU <target> 
	- Perform a UDP scan to find open UDP ports on the target.

nmap -O <target> 
	- Perform OS detection against the target to determine the operating system running on the host.

nmap -A <target> 
	- Aggressive scan options including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

nmap -p- <target> 
	- Scan all 65,535 TCP ports on the target.

nmap -F <target> 
	- Scan only the most common 100 ports on the target.

nmap -sV <target> 
	- Probe open ports to determine service and version information.

nmap -v <target> 
	- Increase verbosity level to get more detailed output during the scan.

nmap -oA <output_prefix> <target> 
	- Output scan results in three formats: normal, XML, and grepable.

nmap -T4 <target> 
	- Set timing template to aggressive, increasing scan speed at the cost of reliability.

nmap -PN <target> 
	- Treat all hosts as online, skipping host discovery.

nmap --script vuln <target> 
	- Run NSE scripts to detect known vulnerabilities on the target.

nmap --traceroute <target> 
	- Perform traceroute to the target host to discover the path packets take.

nmap -sX <target> 
	- Perform Xmas tree scan, setting FIN, URG, and PUSH flags to probe for open ports.

nmap -sN <target> 
	- Perform Null scan, sending packets with no TCP flag set to identify open ports.

nmap -sF <target> 
	- Perform FIN scan, sending packets with only the FIN flag set to detect open ports.

nmap -sP <target> 
	- Perform a ping scan to determine which hosts are online without scanning ports.

nmap -sL <targets_file> - List scan, simply list targets to scan without performing any actual scanning.
